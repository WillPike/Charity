		Worldwide, more than 800 million people struggle with hunger every day. That number has dropped significantly over the past two decades thanks to the painstaking effort of individuals, nonprofits and NGOs alike, but there is much work to be done. Your donation can make a difference. Our Hunger Relief Cause Fund includes our charity members, fully vetted by America's Charities and focused on outcomes-based impact, working toward ending hunger in the U.S. and around the world.
